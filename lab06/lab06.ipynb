If the bins are too large, they may erase important features.

The default bin size is determined using a reference rule that depends on the sample size and variance. This works well in many cases, (i.e., with “well-behaved” data) but it fails in others. It is always a good to try different bin sizes to be sure that you are not missing something important. This function allows you to specify bins in several different ways, such as by setting the total number of bins to use, the width of each bin, or the specific locations where the bins should break\" [Seaborn histplot documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html).\n",
