General usage of `.loc` looks like `df.loc[rowname, colname]`. (Reminder that the colon `:` means \"everything.\")  For example, if we want the `color` column of the `ex` data frame, we would use: `ex.loc[:, 'color']`\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Row Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we want to select a row by its label, we can use the same `.loc` method. In this case, the \"label\" of each row refers to the index (i.e. primary key) of the dataframe.\n",
